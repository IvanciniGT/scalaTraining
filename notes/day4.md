It calculates how many chars needs to be replaced, added or removed in a word to get another word.

Java is both a compiled and interpreted language.
Scala is the same

.java -> compilation -> .class -> interpreted -> JVM
JAVA                    BYTE-CODE
.scala -> compilation ->.class -> interpreted -> JVM
SCALA                   BYTE-CODE


Inside the JVM we have the JIT (Just in time) compiler that compiles the byte-code to machine code.
Since Java v1.2 the JIT compiler is part of the JVM and it has what is called a HotSpot compiler that caches the most used code (machine code)

Java has 2 version with huge improvements:
- JAVA 1.8 -> Functional programming
- JAVA 1.9 -> Modularization (Jigsaw)

Until java 1.8 we could create only classes and interfaces.

public class interface MyInterface {
    public void myMethod();
}

public class MyClass implements MyInterface {
    public void myMethod() {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}

In Java 9, they added the possibility to define modules:

module myModule {
    exports myPackage;
}

API: dictionary.jar

    package com.dictionary;

    public interface Dictionary {
        String getLanguage();
        boolean exists(String word);
        String getDefinition(String word);
        Optional<String[]> getSuggestions(String word);
    }

    module dictionary {
        exports com.dictionary;
    }

Implementation of that dictionary.jar working with files... Maybe in the future we may want to have a Data base

    package com.dictionary;

    public interface DictionaryFactory {
        static Dictionary getInstance(String language) { // JAVA 1.8
            return new DictionaryImpl(language);
        }
    }
    
    package com.dictionary.impl;

    public class DictionaryImpl implements Dictionary {
        public DictionaryImpl(String language) {
            // A BUNCH OF CODE
        }
        // A BUNCH OF CODE
    }

    module dictionary.impl {
        exports com.dictionary;
        requires dictionary;
        provides com.dictionary.Dictionary with com.dictionary.impl.DictionaryImpl;
    }

Let's create an app, using a dictionary

    package com.app;

    import com.dictionary.Dictionary;
    import com.dictionary.DictionaryFactory;
    // import com.dictionary.impl.DictionaryImpl; // THIS THIS WE HAVE DONE ... I MEAN ... THIS LINE OF CODE
                                               // IS COMPLETLY FORBIDDEN. THIS IS THE MOST HORRIBLE THING I COULD DO IN MY LIFE

    public class App {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            String language = args[0];
            String word = args[1];
            //Dictionary dictionary = DictionaryFactory.getDictionary(language); // THIS IS OK
            Dictionary dictionary = ServiceLoader.load(Dictionary.class).findFirst().orElseThrow(); // JAVA 9
            //Dictionary dictionary = new DictionaryImpl(language);  FORBIDDEN 
            boolean exists = dictionary.exists(word);
            // To do something
        }
    }

Have your heard about SOLID principles? 5 principles that help us to write better code, but also more maintainable code.
The fifth principle is called Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
    It says that a high order class cannot depend on a low order component implementation, It has to depend on an abstraction (interface)

A way of respecting the DIP is by using that programming strategy called Dependency Injection (DI)

DI: Is just that a class is not going to create instances of objects it needs... Those are going to be provided to the class  รง


In JAVA we have the most huge framework (200 libraries) ever called Spring
Spring is an IoC container (Inversion of Control)
IoC is just a programming strategy that allows us to respect the DIP by making easy to inject dependencies into a class
